Mod10-MiniProject


Description:In this project, I built a Pokémon-themed web application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The app includes a homepage with a login form, a Pokedex search page, and a Pokémon details page. Users can search for any Pokémon, and the app fetches real-time data from the PokeAPI to display details like the Pokémon's name, image, abilities, and base experience. I used JavaScript with async/await to handle API requests and dynamically update the content based on user input. Bootstrap helped me create a responsive design, making the app user-friendly across devices. This project demonstrates my understanding of front-end development, API integration, and building interactive web applications—skills I’m developing on my path to becoming a full-stack developer.
